This is my personal stuff,

the fact that these things are shared doesn't mean that I'm very proud of them,

in fact, if you're reading this is probably because you're my boss or a companion.

If that's the case stop laughing, remember that that a bad programmer doesn't mean a bad ninja killer.

End.
